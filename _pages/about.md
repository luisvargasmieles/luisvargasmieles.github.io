I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 2011 and 2016, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Engineering and a master's degree, respectively, at the Polytechnic School of the Littoral (ESPOL). From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a University teacher in ESPOL, I taught Single and Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. In 2018, I was awarded a Master's Degree in Computational Applied Mathematics with distinction at the University of Edinburgh.

My research has been focused on the development of accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian computational imaging. The high dimensionality of images and the stiffness of certain inverse problems makes the use of standard MCMC methods inefficient, so my main objective is to propose enhanced sampling methods that exhibit significantly faster convergence rates, larger effective sample sizes and/or lower mean-square estimation errors at equal computational budget than state-of-the-art algorithms.

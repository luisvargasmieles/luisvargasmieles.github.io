I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 2011 I obtained my bachelor's degree in Engineering at the Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral (Polytechnic School of the Littoral - ESPOL). From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a University teacher at ESPOL, teaching Single and Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. In 2018, I was awarded a Master's Degree in Computational Applied Mathematics with distinction from the University of Edinburgh and since September 2018 I have been working as a PhD student at the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Dr Konstantinos C. Zygalakis and Dr Marcelo Pereyra.

My research has focused on the development and implementation of accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian computational imaging. The high dimensionality of the data and the poor conditioning of a significant number of inverse problems make the use of standard MCMC methods ineffective, so my main goal is to propose enhanced sampling methods that exhibit significantly faster convergence rates, larger effective sample sizes and/or higher precision with a computational budget similar to state-of-the-art algorithms.

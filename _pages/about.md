I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 2011 I obtained my Engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral (Polytechnic School of the Littoral - ESPOL). From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a University teacher at ESPOL, teaching Single and Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. In 2018, I obtained an MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics with distinction at the University of Edinburgh. In 2018 I was awarded a School of Mathematics Studentship to undertake postgraduate study within the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, and in 2022 I obtained my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics, under the supervision of Dr Konstantinos C. Zygalakis and Dr Marcelo Pereyra.

During my PhD, I focused on the development and implementation of accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian computation in imaging. The large dimensionality of the images and the ill-conditioning of a significant number of inverse problems make the use of standard MCMC methods computationally expensive, so my main goal was to propose enhanced sampling methods that exhibit significantly faster convergence rates, larger effective sample sizes and/or higher accuracy with a computational budget similar to Euler-Maruyama-based algorithms, such as the so-called unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA).

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID) at the Department of Medicine of the University of Cambridge, working with [Chris Wallace](http://chr1swallace.github.io/){:target="_blank"} to study and propose more biologically interesting clustering and dimensionality reduction methods on gene expression data.

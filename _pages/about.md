I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 2011 and 2016, I received a bachelor's degree in Engineering and a master's degree at the Litoral Polytechnic School (ESPOL). From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a University teacher in ESPOL, I taught Single and Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. In 2018, I was awarded a Master's Degree in Computational Applied Mathematics with distinction at the University of Edinburgh.

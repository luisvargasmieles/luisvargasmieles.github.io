I talked about the results of my [first scientific publication](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M1283719). I presented a highly efficient proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to perform Bayesian computation in imaging problems, derived from an approximation of the Langevin diffusion and based on a state-of-the-art orthogonal Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev stochastic approximation that combines several gradient evaluations to significantly accelerate its convergence speed, similarly to accelerated gradient optimization methods. The proposed methodology efficiently deal with stiff and high dimensional problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as the Moreau-Yosida unadjusted Langevin algorithm (MYULA).

Similar to the poster I presented in Corfu (Greece), I gave a poster presentation about more sophisticated numerical schemes to accelerate the sampling of approximated target distributions in Bayesian Imaging Inverse problems, called Stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods (S-ROCK), which efficiently deal with stiff and high dimensional problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as the Moreau-Yosida unadjusted Langevin algorithm (MYULA).
